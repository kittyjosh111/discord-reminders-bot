# Discord bot that serves as a to-do application
# Creates daily to-do lists and sends reminders every X hours
# Can be communicated with to create new tasks with
# varying categories, and be marked done/not done through chat.
# Tasks are saved as a list of dicts to a file, named by MM-DD-YYYY
# Each new day, a new task list is created and saved.
#
# Also, a template file can be made. It takes in a list of
# day, content. When creating a new daily list, we look through the template
# and pre-fill that day's list with predefined tasks.
#
# A task should look like this:
# [ [id, [{"content": content}, {"status": status}]] ]
# Basically, a list whose index 0 is an ID, and 1 is a list of dicts
